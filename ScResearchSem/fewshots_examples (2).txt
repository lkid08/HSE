Write a comparison summary of "Eclipse" and "NetBeans". Summarize only relevant arguments from the list. After the summary, list the argument numbers you used below the text. Put citations in brackets inside the text. Do not even mention arguments that are not relevant to "Eclipse" and "NetBeans".

1. Eclipse also has a more mature and better designed plug-in architecture, which makes it faster and easier for BEA to switch to Eclipse than to Netbeans.
2. At that time, we chose Eclipse because it was faster and it looked better than NetBeans.
3. UI Response : What ever may be the reason, Eclipse is definitely faster and it has better response times than NetBeans.
4. There are some features I miss from Eclipse (better code completion, auto serial id generator, better missing import handling, quicker project openning, etc.) but overall I feel more comfortable using Netbeans with ExtJS projects than Eclipse.
5. What's probably even more interesting is the memory consumption improvements (with 6.0 being worse than Eclipse and 6.1 being better than Eclipse in the basic scenarios): .
6. I've always heard people saying that eclipse editor is superior to netbeans.
7. While still requiring a Java runtime, PhpStorm feels much faster than eclipse or even the lighter weight Netbeans IDE.
8. Eclipse PDT in version 3.6 is mooore quicker then Netbeans!
9. To me, Eclipse is better than NetBeans, but, IDEA is better than both of Eclipse and NetBeans.
10. Thankfully there's Netbeans which in many if not all ways is superior to Eclipse.
11. NetBeans for Python is my current favorite (lighter and so much easier to install than Eclipse I found).
12. No there isnt and I am hoping that changes soon because honestly Netbeans is a lot easier and simpler to use than Eclipse is.
13. Hi You guys have done a great job Netbeans is much faster and it always had better features than Eclipse.
14. No, Netbeans doesn't support Facelets either but it seems to have better server (start/restart/deploy) support than MyEclipse, better UML support and it seems faster than Eclipse and definitely lower mem footprint.
15. I have the "Netbeans RCP" book at home, I built some examples with it, and it basically is all just a bit easier and nicer to use than Eclipse RCP.
16. BTW, I must say that NetBeans has several performance problems, so I rather did some easier refactoring by hand (it was much faster than NB ) or used Eclipse and find/sed for some tasks.
17. Regarding NetBeans, Milinkovich said Sun does a good job of marketing the things NetBeans does better than Eclipse, such as Java profiling and GUI building with the Matisse technology.
18. I've heard Netbeans is now slightly superior to Eclipse.
19. This means NetBeans looks and feels better on OS X than Eclipse.
20. Even Netbeans feels quicker than Eclipse, now.


Answer:

Eclipse and NetBeans are both popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) used for software development, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. 

According to users, Eclipse is generally faster and has better response times than NetBeans [2][3][4][8], which has performance problems [16]. However, some users argue with that, emphasizing that Netbeans has improved and feels quicker [13][14][20] and superior [18] than Eclipse. In terms of features, Eclipse is noted for its more mature and better-designed plug-in architecture [1], as well as its superior editor [6]. 
Some users also appreciate its better code completion, better missing import handling and auto-serial ID generation [4].

On the other hand, some prefer NetBeans over Eclipse for specific projects and tasks (ExtJS [4], Java profiling and GUI building with the Matisse technology [17]), as they state that it has better features [13]. Moreover, NetBeans is praised for better server support [14], UML support, and less memory consumption [11] and lower memory footprint [14].  Some also find it easier to install [11] and to use [12][15]. 

There are also arguments that praise both IDE's depending on personal preferences, e.g. better looking user interface [2][19].

Overall, preferences seem to be divided based on personal experience and the specific needs of the user. You may want to try both and see which one works best for you.

Arguments used: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Answer:

Beer and cider are two popular alcoholic beverages, but they have some differences and similarities. 

While some argue that beer is superior to cider [1], others prefer cider [10] and consider it as a lighter alternative [14][18][20], which is quicker and smoother to go down [11] and better tasting [17]. 

In terms of production, it is said that making beer is cheaper and quicker than making cider [2], while some arguments state that hard cider is easier to brew [13][15][17]. Moreover, making great cider is way harder than making great beer [3][9], as you have way less control and the results are less forgiving [9]. Cider fermentation is slower than beer fermentation because of sulfites [5] and slower in developing flavors [7]. 

Ultimately, the choice between beer and cider is a matter of personal preferences. For example,some people say that there is no better time for beer than the fall [4], and it should be served cold to enjoy its taste [6]. Both beer and cider have a rich history and culture behind them, so exploring different styles and flavors can be a fun and rewarding experience.

Arguments used: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20.

19. Learned that Honda and Nissan are experiencing worse problems than Toyota.
20. Corvettes feel lighter to me than Nissan Zs.


Answer:

Both Nissan and Toyota are reputable car manufacturers with a long history of producing high-quality vehicles. Ultimately, the decision of which brand is better depends on your personal preferences and needs.

Some argue that Nissan has cooler looks and better overall value [3][9], has better rust prevention [5], and offers better deals [6]. Others say that Toyota has nicer styling and interiors [11][12], better resale value [18], better "fit and finish" [14], and better build quality [13]. Furthermore, some argue that Toyota is easier to park due to better visibility of the corners of the car [16]. 

Therefore, the choice between Nissan and Toyota may depend on personal preferences and priorities. It's also a good idea to read reviews and do research on specific models that you're considering to get a better understanding of their performance and reliability (for example, some people say that Nissan 4X4s are better reliable than toyota Landcruisers [7]). 

Arguments used: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18.
